The PyShell.py file accompanying Python has a bug .  
 
http://bugs.python.org/issue5233 is supposed to fix this bug - but did not happen in the latest distro I am using.

The file here maybe a kludgy / temporary fix that seems to work.

You will want to keep a backup copy of the PyShell.py on your system.
Then use this repo-copy to replace it.

Set an environment var called IDLESTARTUP to point to your imports file.
